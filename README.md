# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment

This section has moved here: [https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment)

## 1. Create an ECR repository to store your images.

For example: `aws ecr create-repository --repository-name my-ecr-repo --region us-east-2`. Replace the value of `ECR_REPOSITORY` in the workflow below with your repository's name. Replace the value of `aws-region` in the workflow below with your repository's region.

## 2. Create an ECS task definition, an ECS cluster, and an ECS service.

For example, follow the Getting Started guide on the ECS console: https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ecs/home?region=us-east-2#/firstRun Replace the values for `service` and `cluster` in the workflow below with your service and cluster names.

## 3. Store your ECS task definition as a JSON file in your repository.

The format should follow the output of `aws ecs register-task-definition --generate-cli-skeleton`. Replace the value of `task-definition` in the workflow below with your JSON file's name. Replace the value of `container-name` in the workflow below with the name of the container in the `containerDefinitions` section of the task definition.

## 4. Store an IAM user access key in GitHub Actions secrets named `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.

See the documentation for each action used below for the recommended IAM policies for this IAM user, and best practices on handling the access key credentials.
